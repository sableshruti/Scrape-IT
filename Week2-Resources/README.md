# Week 2

Your target for this week is to learn Pandas, Matplotlib (these two are Python libraries) and HTML and CSS. Pandas is a fast and convinient library for all the data-handling you need to do while analysing data. Matplotlib allows you to visualize that data. Together with NumPy, these two constitue the begineer Data Science toolkit. 

Your goal for this week is to learn the following in Pandas:

- representation of tabular data as Pandas DataFrames.
- using pandas to explore, clean and process your data
- reading and writing tabular data into and out of files 
- calculating summary statistics from data


For Matplotlib, you should get familiar with what kinds of plots can be generated using Matplotlib, and appreciate how versatile Matplotlib is in terms of the variety of types of input objects it can generate plots from (python lists, ndarrays, pd.Series to name a few).

We have provided a tutorial for Pandas and Matplotlib to summarize this week's learnings and motivate some real applications. You should definitely go through that.

After this, we learn the basics of Web to understand how Web-Pages are structured. As you might know, the skeleton of all the web-pages is written in HTML; and CSS and JavaScrpit are used to turn the skeleton into flesh and blood.

For HTML, your first job is to understand how elements of a web-page are strctured i.e. hierarchy of representation of elements in HTML. It is roughly a nested tree structure. We will be using this a lot in web-scrapping. 

Apart from this, do go through the basic tags and attributes. Understand how attributes define element properties. 

For CSS, get an idea of how CSS is used to decorate webpages. We will be using the concept of CSS Selectors, IDs and Classes a lot in Web-Scraping, so make sure you are familiar with these things.

## Recommended Resources

These resources **MAY** be followed to learn the required stuff. 

- Pandas: <https://www.w3schools.com/python/pandas/default.asp> : It is a short module, having one read will be okay
- Matplotlib: <https://www.w3schools.com/python/matplotlib_intro.asp> : Just go over it, you are not expected to remember anything.
- HTML: <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML> 
- CSS: <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS> : for this one, you can skip how to style and animation stuff, but make sure that you understand usage of Selectors.

*Video Tutorials (If you find the web resources difficult to follow)*:

- Web - <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3e-cpL7ofc> (till Chapter 10)

## Tutorial 

Please go through the [tutorial on Pandas](./Pandas-Tutorial/pandas-data-analysis.ipynb) after getting a basic understanding of Pandas and NumPy. It is an excellent and easy to follow example of real data analysis using Python.

## Practice

Watch the video for Web and try to do things given in it.
For web development projects, there are a lot. If you search on github, you will find many. Don't go on a project spree doing all of them. Take a look at which one you find difficult/don't know how to and then start it.

>[!NOTE]
> As you would have realised by now, there are a overwhelming number of functions and methods for each Python library you have seen till now. However in practice, you will only be using a small subset of them depending on your niche. So don't get in a FOMO of not learning everything out there. You will pick up whatever is necessary on the go.
