# Week 1

All of this might be overwhelming if you are a beginner. So don't lose confidence and keep on finishing the tasks. Everything will eventually start making sense. Also please don't leave backlogs, especially in the beginning. 

We will kick off with learning Python and NumPy. NumPy is a Python library (find out what a library is) which has a uses ranging from Data Analysis, Scientific Computing to Machine Learning. 

## Setting Up The Environment

- Configure Python on your system. Using VS Code is recommended. (There are numerous videos on YT for this)

- Save these documentations for reference: [Python](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html), [NumPy](https://numpy.org/doc/1.26/user/absolute_beginners.html), [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/getting_started/index.html#getting-started) and [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/stable/index.html)   

> [!NOTE] 
> You should get comfortable with reading documentation. Having the ability to navigate through formal documentation is must for a programmer.

- Understanding [Python Virtual Environment](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-virtual-environment/) (Can be skipped)

- Setting up Jupyter: Jupyter is a platform which lets you write and run code and visualize data in one place. You can skip this if you want but eventually at some point in your life, you will have to work on Jupyter.
  - For Windows Users: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/install-jupyter-notebook-in-windows/ 
  - For Mac Users: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-install-jupyter-notebook-on-macos/ 
  - For Linux Users: you are smart enough to figure it out yourselves 

  Using VS Code is highly recommended. The instructions for setting up Jupyter can be found [here](https://medium.com/@claudia.nikel/how-to-setup-a-jupyter-notebook-in-vs-code-w-virtual-env-kernels-install-packages-884cf643375e)

- Understanding GitHub: go through [this](https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/github-and-git-tutorial-for-beginners) for a basic exposure with specific focus on how to stage and commit changes, pushing and pulling changes to and from origin (don't let these terms overwhelm you)

> [!TIP]
> You are advised to go through the Python Basics part rigourously. For the Numpy, Pandas and Matplotlib, doing a quick rundown shall suffice.

### Resources
  
  - Python - https://www.w3schools.com/python/default.asp : For starters you can read till Python File Handling
  - Numpy -https://www.w3schools.com/python/numpy/default.asp : For starters you can read till NumPy Array Filtering

Tutorials have also been uploaded, which you can go through for a quick refresher. 

> [!NOTE]
> There are plenty of resources available for the stuff you are suposed to learn this week. So you can choose any one which you like. However, do not get lost in learnign everything in detail. It's okay if you don't remember everything you read. You can always look stuff up on Google or in the documentation if needed.   

### Practice 

Here are some good practice problems (optional)
