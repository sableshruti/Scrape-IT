# WiDS 5.0 – Analytics Club IIT Bombay

This repository contains my work and learnings developed during **WiDS 5.0**, conducted by the
Analytics Club, IIT Bombay. 

## About this Repository

This repository was initially forked as part of the WiDS 5.0 program structure, as instructed by
the mentor. All analyses, assignments, and project implementations included here were carried
out by me during the course of WiDS 5.0.

## Key Learnings

- Python programming for data analysis
- Web scraping using **Selenium** and **BeautifulSoup**
- Handling dynamic, JavaScript-rendered websites
- Structuring raw data into clean, analyzable formats
- Debugging real-world code and dealing with scraping limitations

### Week 1 – Data Analysis with Pandas and Matplotlib

Performed exploratory data analysis on the 2011 Census dataset using Pandas.
The task involved cleaning data, comparing urban–rural literacy rates across states,
analyzing gender-based disparities, and studying sector-wise distribution of the
working population. Visualizations were created using Matplotlib to interpret trends
and differences across states.

### Week 2 – Understanding Structured Web Data (HTML)

Created a structured HTML page to represent movie-related data in tabular form.
This task focused on understanding how real-world data is organized on web pages,
including rows, columns, and links, building foundational intuition for web scraping
and data extraction tasks in later weeks.

## Projects Included

### 1. IMDb Movies Web Scraping Project
- Scraped IMDb Top 100 movies
- Extracted movie-level information such as IMDb rating and movie URLs
- Extracted top 10 cast members for each movie
- Designed a normalized data structure using IMDb IDs
- Stored results in structured CSV files for further analysis

(Project file are available inside the WiDS project folder.)

## Tools and Technologies Used

- Python
- Selenium
- BeautifulSoup
- Pandas
- Chrome WebDriver

## Outcome

This repository documents my learning journey through WiDS 5.0 and demonstrates the practical
application of data analytics concepts on real-world web data.
