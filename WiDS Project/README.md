# WiDS 5.0 – Analytics Club IIT Bombay

This repository contains my work and learnings developed during **WiDS 5.0**, conducted by the
Analytics Club, IIT Bombay. The projects focus on applying Python for data collection,
processing, and basic analytics, with an emphasis on real-world datasets.

## About this Repository

This repository was initially forked as part of the WiDS 5.0 program structure, as instructed by
the mentor. All analyses, experiments, and project implementations included here were carried
out by me during the course of WiDS 5.0.

## Key Learnings

- Python programming for data analysis
- Web scraping using **Selenium** and **BeautifulSoup**
- Handling dynamic, JavaScript-rendered websites
- Structuring raw data into clean, analyzable formats
- Debugging real-world code and dealing with scraping limitations

## Projects Included

### 1. IMDb Movies Web Scraping Project
- Scraped IMDb Top 100 movies
- Extracted movie-level information such as IMDb rating and movie URLs
- Extracted top 10 cast members for each movie
- Designed a normalized data structure using IMDb IDs
- Stored results in structured CSV files for further analysis

(Project files and detailed explanation are available inside the project folder.)

## Tools and Technologies Used

- Python
- Selenium
- BeautifulSoup
- Pandas
- Chrome WebDriver

## Outcome

This repository documents my learning journey through WiDS 5.0 and demonstrates the practical
application of data analytics concepts on real-world web data.
